                in earth observation, the onset of the Internet of Things, distributed ledgers and our mobile devices
                hold a rich potential to transform the way we deal with environmental challenges. Never has there been
                such innovation and enabling factors as we now experience to help us better understand our world and the
                natural resources we rely on, and how we as humans could better engage as custodians. ‘Digital
                Transformation’, ‘Disruption’ and ‘The 4th Industrial Revolution’ are terms so often bandied about, but
                what do these mean? More importantly, what do they mean for the wildlife economy?</p>
